AS A student user,
I WANT TO find items and purchase them safely within my campus community,
TO quickly discover what I need, coordinate pickup, and complete the sale with confidence
SO THAT I can buy from verified students without using public marketplaces.

SCENARIO: Search by Category
GIVEN I am on the Browse page,
WHEN I tap a category chip (e.g., “Textbooks”, “Furniture”),
AND optional filters are set (price range, condition),
THEN the listing grid should update to show only matching items
WITHIN 1 second,
AND a “No results” empty state should appear if there are zero matches.

SCENARIO: View Listing Details
GIVEN filtered results are shown,
WHEN I tap a listing card,
THEN the Listing Details page should open
WITHIN 2 seconds,
AND display photos, price, description, condition, and the seller mini-profile (name, rating, member since).

SCENARIO: Request to Buy (Start Deal)
GIVEN I am on the Listing Details page,
WHEN I tap “Contact / Request to Buy”,
THEN an in-app chat thread with the seller should open
WITHIN 2 seconds,
AND a system message should create a proposed deal tied to this listing.

SCENARIO: Set Meetup & Confirm Pickup
GIVEN a deal is accepted,
WHEN a meetup time/place is set in the chat’s deal card,
AND the buyer taps Confirm Pickup after the exchange,
THEN the deal should be marked completed
WITHIN 1 second,
AND the listing should be marked sold and removed from active results
WITHIN 2 seconds.

SCENARIO: Post-Completion Rating Prompt
GIVEN a deal is completed,
WHEN I return to the app,
THEN I should see a prompt to rate the other party (1–5 stars + quick tags)
WITHIN 1 second,
AND submitting a rating should update the user’s average rating
WITHIN 2 seconds.

SCENARIO: Error & Safety Handling
GIVEN the network is unavailable or the seller is unresponsive,
WHEN I attempt to request, accept, or confirm,
THEN I should see a clear error or “Waiting for other party” status
WITHIN 1 second,
AND I should be able to cancel the deal and return to Browse
WITHIN 1 second.

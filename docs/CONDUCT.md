## 305Soft Team Policies

### No Distracted Technology Use
All team members agree to the 305Soft policy of no distracted technology use during meetings. Phones, unrelated devices, and non-project tabs must remain closed to ensure full engagement and respect for everyone’s time.

### Decision-Making
Decisions will be made by **majority vote** whenever possible. If a consensus cannot be reached, the Scrum Master will mediate, and the team will revisit the decision after review or input from the Product Owner.

### Attendance
Members are expected to attend **all scheduled team meetings** and be present for the **full duration**.  
Legitimate reasons for missing include illness, emergencies, or class conflicts (communicated in advance).  
Members who miss a meeting must review meeting notes and update their assigned tasks within 24 hours.

### Assignments
Tasks will be assigned during sprint planning based on skill sets and workload.  
If a member fails to complete or poorly completes an assignment, the team will first address it privately to determine the cause and assist. Continued lack of contribution will be escalated to the Scrum Master and instructor.

### Participation
All members are expected to communicate through **GitHub Issues**, **Project Boards**, and **Slack/Discord** for collaboration.  
We will honor everyone’s strengths — technical, design, or coordination — by assigning fitting responsibilities to encourage full engagement.

### Meeting Times and Mediums
Meetings will be scheduled based on collective availability using a shared calendar.  
In-person or virtual meetings (via Zoom/Google Meet) must be agreed upon at least 24 hours in advance.

### Promptness
Team members are expected to arrive or log in **on time**.  
If running late, a message must be sent in the team group chat. Repeated lateness without notice will be noted in sprint reviews.

### Conversational Courtesies
We will practice **active listening** and encourage equal airtime.  
All feedback must remain **constructive and professional**, focusing on ideas rather than individuals.

### Enforcement and Feedback
All team members share responsibility for upholding this Code of Conduct.  
Violations or concerns should be discussed respectfully within the team or reported to the **Scrum Master** Paolo Montelbano (paolo.montelbano@uri.edu).  
Feedback should be given privately and respectfully, with the goal of maintaining a supportive environment.
